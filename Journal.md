So full disclosure I highkey didn't realize I needed to submit a journal until like July 22nd so most of the stuff will be made in a single commit. My "entries" are based off my memory of my thoughts and Onshape's incredibly accurate logging system(which logs EVERYTHING like even stuff as simple as showing/hiding parts down to which minute they happened).

# 7-14 | Determining Requirements

I've finally decided to make a laptop stand after nearly burning my hands for the hundreth time or so. Did some research on previous solutions to Macbook Air overheating, and found LLT and Max Tech's videos particularly informative. They both used thermal pads to heatsink the CPU's heat to the metal shell of the laptop. Max went even further by adding a magsafe magnet inside and clipping on a third-party iPhone magsafe fan, which was kinda epic. I want to do something like that too with an active cooling system.
I considered a proper heatsink and determined that it probably won't be nessecary given the already impressive performance increase and temperature decrease Max saw with just one baby fan and no proper heatsink as well. I think I will go ahead with two fans, probably from Noctua. A friend reccomended this brand to me and after some research it seems they have some of the best performing fans while also being very quiet, which is pretty cool.

As for the actual CAD, I made the document and that's about it.
